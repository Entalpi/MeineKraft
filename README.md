**MeineKraft** is a **rendering engine** written in **C++14** & **OpenGL 4.1**.
My intent is to follow up the implementation of the most interesting parts with some articles relating to my learning experience,
these articles can be found on my personal [site](http://lingtorp.com).

# Build
All the dependencies are bundled within the folder /include.

# Dependencies
* [dear imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for debug GUI.
* [assimp](https://github.com/syoyo/assimp) for model importing.

# TODO
- [ ] Procedural generation
    - [Â ] Perlin Noise
    - [ ] Simplex Noise

Lightning
- [x] Phong lightning 

Rendering
- [x] Merge all model matrices into a single matrix
- [x] Use instanced rendering
- [x] Line of sight distance
- [x] View frustrum culling (geometric approach)
- [ ] Ray tracing for entity selection
- [ ] Merge all 3 transformation matrices into one
- [ ] Frustrum cull checks against parent Nodes (nodes with children)
- [x] Resolution independence
- []  Watch shader files for changes (auto) reload them. It broked.
- [x] Importing Meshes (tinyobjloader)
- [x] Deduplication of imported Meshes
- [x] Immediate mode GUI (imgui)
- [ ] Use quaterions for transformations
- [ ] Implement a job system
- [ ] Scene graph - with transforms and node parents
- [ ]  Hit point cursor
- [ ] Smoother movement
- [ ] Avoid costly matrix multiplications somehow (scale, rotate_XYZ, etc)
- [x] Add atomics to the FileMonitoring
- [ ] Add move constructors and move assignment operators to all Vector types, measure the performance increase!
- [ ] Make Vector types for-range-able
- [x] Import .obj with texture data and more
- [ ] Normal mapping!
- [x] Diffuse textures
- [ ] Console with lua or something to apply translations/transforms
- [x] Multiple lights - uniform buffers
- [ ] Per object diffuse texture - texture buffers (?)
- [ ] Translate normals and trnasform them if object moves
- [ ] Blinn-Phong shading
- [ ] Light material: light power, light color,

Code hygiene
- [ ] Prefix all functions that touch OpenGL with "gl_"
- [ ] Change all OpenGL specific location from uint64_t to uint32_t since OpenGL maps it's indices to int (32 bits).
